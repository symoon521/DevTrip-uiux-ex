## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) which translates to RGB Hex #3399FF. This color evokes the sense of clear skies and open horizons, fitting with the travel theme. Avoids the cliche of using green for learning applications, offering a fresher feel.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) which translates to RGB Hex #F0F8FF. A light tint of the primary color creates subtle unity while maintaining brightness for readability.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) which translates to RGB Hex #33CCCC. This closely related hue offers noticeable contrast due to the change in both brightness and saturation, visually highlighting key interactive elements without clashing with the primary blue.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for both headlines and body text, lends a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use a consistent layout with clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the platform. Implement responsive design to ensure the platform is accessible on various devices.
- Employ travel-themed icons related to DevOps concepts (e.g., airplanes for deployment, suitcases for migration) to enhance engagement and comprehension.
- Incorporate subtle animations to create a sense of dynamism and progression as users complete missions (e.g., a plane flying to a new location upon mission completion).
